# Responsive Portfolio 

This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio. With the homepage being my Bio information.
The navigation bar at the top links to each page below. 
At the bottom of each page, there is a credit to the creators of the icons used throughout the website.

# About Me

Includes profile picture, list of skills, and short paragraph about myself. 

# Portfolio

This page has 3 cards that link to my projects. 
The first card links to my most recent project for standarizing a code.
The second card links to my Rezz Fan Page that was part of the pre-work for the bootcamp I am currently enrolled in. 
   Note: The Rezz Fan page unfortunately is not working at the time. The site is published on gitPages but link still shows an error.
The last card has been left empty to allow for the next project to fill it in. 

# Contact 

This page allows for any user to contact me with questions or comments.
The LinkedIn Logo links to my LinkedIn
The Gmail Logo pulls up my email for the use to copy and paste. 
The actual form itself still requires back-end development, for now the form is unable to send user inputs to me.
